# spaceflight-cli

## About

This is a simple wrapper around the Launch Library 2 API, written in Rust. I wrote this because I noticed a distinct lack of RSS feeds and cli apps for anything related to space.

## Installation

This was compiled with `nightly-2023-01-20-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` but it could probably be done with other toolchains, otherwise feel free to open an issue.
